# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
### The Purpose of this analysis was to show the relationship between ridesharing data and Urban/Suburban/Rural areas during a 5 month period to determine how to improve accessibility and affordability.
## Results:
### Rural areas get very few rides and have less drivers than they do rides. Rides are more expensive due to scarcity. Suburban areas have more ride requests than they do drivers, and the average ride costs a little less. Urban areas have more drivers than they do ride requests, making rides a lot less expensive than in other areas, and also making drivers in these areas earn less. 
## Summary:
### Rec 1: Create incentives for urban drivers to drive out to suburban areas in the vicinity to even out demand. 
### Rec 2: By decreasing costs in Rural areas, there might be a higher demand for rides, increasing the number of drivers, and creating a positive cycle. 
### Rec 3: Focus development on the Suburban areas, as Rural areas have capped growth due to limited population, and Urban areas are saturated.
